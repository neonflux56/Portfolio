## Introduction

<div style="text-align:justify"><span>
Like the commonly used machine learning quote goes, "Treat your data like a product, not as a project", this web application was envisioned as an asset for users with little or no background understanding of dealing with text data. The dynamic nature of this app allows for a user to perform text analytics, mainly topic and sentiment analysis, on any text data.

<div style="text-align:justify"><span>
The app works in three stages:
</span></div>
<br>
- ### 1. Load Stage
<br>
<div style="text-align:justify"><span>
The user gets to upload data in a csv file or hit Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) to fetch data into the tool. The user gets to see a preview of the collected data and decide the field that becomes the response and the field on which text models are applied.
</span></div>
- ### 2. Process Stage
<br>
<div style="text-align:justify"><span>
This is the stage where data cleaning and modelling takes place. The user gets a glimpse of general summaries of the dataset like the Tf-Idf scores, frequency counts etc. The user gets to annotate the word collection accordingly. The tool also allows the user to try different configuration parameters for running various models. 
</span></div>

- ### 3. Insights Stage
<br>
<div style="text-align:justify"><span>
This stage displays a set of tailored charts and visuals corresponding to the configured outputs for the user to make sense of the data. The plots are grouped by each response field categories making the analysis more granular and comprehensive.
</span></div>

## Dashboard Design and Implementation


### Home Tab

<div style="text-align:justify"><span>
The front end interface is also laid out in the three-stage fashion of the app's architecture for ease of interpretation. The first tab is the home page which comprises of the introduction to the tool and the instructions to use it.
