abstract: India is an extremely populous country with a massive population of 1.2 billion residents, and a large proportion of people with disabilities in both rural and urban India. Speech impairment is common with people with hearing loss since birth. Among the total disabled population, about 27% have movement constraints and hence are confined to wheelchairs. This paper proposes the idea of using machine learning implementation to develop a device that can benefit the speech and motion constrained population. Gesture control plays an essential role in order to convert the sensor data into speech output or operating a pick and place bot for the motion constrained. Various algorithms are interfaced with the device to provide efficient functionality and throughput. Machine learning and data analytics technologies have been on the rise recently and are finding applications in various domains and industries.
